Project overview:
In the banking industry, a lot of importance is given to telemarketing as high profits are obtained with reduced costs.
It is a classification model. The model predicts if the client will subscribe to a term deposit or not.
It is required to make client selection decision.

Dataset is obtained from UCI Machine Learning repository.
It is a imbalanced dataset with few subscriptions to the term deposit. It has no missing
values, no group structure and not a time-series data set.

ML Algorithms used are:
• Logistic Regression with L1 regularization 
• Logistic Regression with L2 regularization 
• Random Forest Classifier
• XGBoost Classifier
